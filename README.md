## Why 💭
There are dozens of apps/scripts for downloading moodle resources out there, however, none of them are operable by a non-IT student. For instance, an average art student doesn't know (or doesn't even care) how to execute terminal commands to get those moodle files, therefore I decided to create an average-user-friendly tool! Additionally, this is my exercise in both improving my javascript and better understand how google analytics and chrome apis work (mostly the latter!)

## Download ⬇️
Install the latest version of MoodleDownloader from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodle-downloader/ohhocacnnfaiphiahofcnfakdcfldbnh).

If you prefer to install manually, you can find the latest binaries [here](https://github.com/harsilspatel/MoodleDownloader/releases/latest).

## Usage 🖱
1. Login in to your moodle (for example https://moodle.vle.monash.edu)
2. Open the week (section) from where you would like to download the resources from
3. Click on the extension icon and select the resources to be downloaded.
    - Click and drag or use ⌘ key to select multiple options:
4. Hit the `Download` button to get the resources!
